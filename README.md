# NOAAdatabase

This project is written in java and uses the NOAA weather database. This program uses a GUI created in scenebuilder to 
first gather the data from the website. Using a dropdown menu the user can select its station with its annual percipation 
for the default year 2016 (this year is a changeable variable) and find the similar stations with its annual percipation 
using Dijsktra's simmiliarty metric.
